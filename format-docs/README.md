a hypocenter as part of a location.
* [ErrorEllipse](ErrorEllipse.md) Object - An object that contains information
about an error ellipse as part of a location.
* [Pick](Pick.md) Object - An object that contains information about picks
associated with a location.
* [Site](Site.md) Object - An object that defines the source station for a pick.
