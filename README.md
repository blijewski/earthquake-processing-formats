# Processing Formats

The US Geological Survey (USGS) National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC)
defines a number of data exchange formats to communicate seismic event processing
information between seismic data services and/or algorithms. These formats 
are defined using objects as defined in the [JSON standard](http://www.json.org).

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Define formats to hold data representing the estimates of various types of
seismic event detections.
2. Store the format definitions in a source controlled manner.
3. Host libraries used to generate and parse the formats
